I am currently rebuilding all my completed projects. I will be uploading them and adding them here once I am happy with my solutions to these projects.

## C Piscine
**[C Piscine C 00](https://github.com/3ka1tz/c-piscine-c-00)**  
This module is an introduction to C programming. You will learn how the write function works, as well as how loops operate.

**[C Piscine C 01](https://github.com/3ka1tz/c-piscine-c-01)**  
This module introduces C programming. You will enhance your skills in using loops more advancedly than in the previous module.

**[C Piscine C 02](https://github.com/3ka1tz/c-piscine-c-02)**  
This module is an introduction to C programming. In this module, you will learn how to enhance your functions by implementing parameter validation and control mechanisms.

**[C Piscine C 03](https://github.com/3ka1tz/c-piscine-c-03)**  
This module introduces C programming. You will learn how to manipulate strings in this module.

**[C Piscine C 04](https://github.com/3ka1tz/c-piscine-c-04)**  
This module provides an introduction to C programming. In this module, you will continue working with strings and learn how to manipulate integers.

**[C Piscine C 05](https://github.com/3ka1tz/c-piscine-c-05)**  
This module provides an introduction to C programming. You will be required to implement small algorithms using recursive programming.

**[C Piscine C 06](https://github.com/3ka1tz/c-piscine-c-06)**  
This module is an introduction to C programming. You will learn how to use C arguments not only in your functions but also in your program as a whole.
